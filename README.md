# 🎭 You Wanna Know How I Got These Scars?

> _My father was a drinker, and a fiend..._

---

One night, he goes off **crazier than usual**.  
Mommy grabs the **kitchen knife** to defend herself.

But he doesn't like that.

**Not. One. Bit.**

So, with me watching...

> **He takes the knife to her, laughing while he does it.**

Then, he turns to me and says:

## 🃏 _"Why so serious?"_

He comes at me with the knife.

## 🃏 _"Why so serious?"_

He sticks the blade in my mouth.

### 🔪 _"Let's put a smile on that face!"_

---

💀 **And... why so serious?**
